						<h2>About me</h2>
					</div>
					<div class="panel-body">
						<p> I am an Assistant Professor in the <a href="https://engineering.virginia.edu/departments/electrical-and-computer-engineering">Department of electrical and computer engineering</a> at the University of Virginia (UVa). I completed my PhD in 2017 in electrical engineering at the University of Michgan, where I worked with <a href="http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~fessler/">Jeff Fessler</a> and <a href="https://finelli.engin.umich.edu/">Cindy Finelli</a>. My interests are broadly in the fields of image reconstruction and electrical engineering education, and I am a member of <a href="https://www.ieee.org/">IEEE</a> and <a href="https://www.asee.org/">ASEE</a>.  </p>
						<p>Before entering graduate school, I worked in goverment contracting for two years as a systems and image quality engineer at Vencore. I have also done multiple internships, including at Leidos, the Naval Research Laboratory in Washington, DC, and Maxar. </p>
						<p>My primary focus as a professor is teaching. I occasionally work with undergraduate students on research, mostly in the field of engineering education, but I do not have a lab for graduate students. At the University of Michigan, I was a graduate student instructor for <a href ="https://bulletin.engin.umich.edu/courses/eecs/">EECS 551</a>. Since starting at UVa in 2022, I have taught: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Spring 2024: Intro to ML (ECE 2410)</li>
  <li>Spring 2023: Fundamentals 2 (ECE 2660)</li>
  <li>Fall 2022: Fundamentals 3 (ECE 3750)</li>
</ul>
						<p>Most of my spare time belongs to my family, including our rescue border collie mix, <a href="oreo.html">Oreo</a>. I also enjoy knitting (fellow knitters: check out lineycroc on <a href="https://www.ravelry.com/">ravelry</a>), reading, and many crafts. While I don't do much on-the-air talking, I am a licensed <a href="http://www.arrl.org/what-is-ham-radio"> amateur radio </a> operator.</p>
